    "Smear is a trick-taking game from the All Fours style of card games. The game is played with a standard 52 card deck with one joker added. The rank of cards consist of A (high), K, Q, J, Joker, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. The object of the game is to be the first to reach 11 total points by scoring the high, low, jack, joker, or game through several rounds. You can score these point in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "High: The highest trump played in the round (Ace is guarrenteed high)\n",
    "\n",
    "Low: The lowest trump played in the round (2 is guarrenteed low)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jack: Take the trick containing the Jack of trump\n",
    "\n",
    "Joker: Take the trick containing the Joker\n",
    "\n",
    "Game: Take more points of game than the other players. The ranks of cards are assigned points towards game in the following way:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        A: 4\n",
    "        K: 3\n",
    "        Q: 2\n",
    "        J: 1\n",
    "        10: 10\n",
    "Each suit counts the same amount towards game, no matter trump or nontrump        \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The game starts by dealing out six cards to each player in a packets of three. The person to the left of the dealer begins the bidding. They can either pass the bid or choose to bid X, from 0 to 5, where X is how many points they think they can take. Bidding continues until everyone gets a chance to outbid. To prevent ties, each bid must be higher than the current highest. Whoever bids the highest wins the bid and gets to choose the suit of trump. After trump has been declared, all players discard their cards that aren't trump and their hands are replenished to six cards. The discards are public knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing the cards begins by the bid winner leading trump. All players are required to play trump if they have any. Then whoever played the highest card wins the trick and takes home the cards played. Then whoever won the last trick can choose any card to play next, and all players must follow suit OR play trump. If they can't do either, then they can play any card but they have no chance to take the trick. Play continues likewise until all cards have been played. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring takes place after all cards are played. Those who didn't win the bid score the points they took. The bid winner must score at least what he bid in order to MAKE their bid. If they make their bid, they score the points they took. If they MISSED their bid, they do not score anything this round but instead subtract their bid from their total score. Once the round has been scored, the person to the left of the dealer becomes the new dealer and a new round begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample round of Smear as played by the computer. The first block of code is creating the classes and methods to help the game run smoothly and the rest is the game being played with commentary to help walk you through what's going on. I added in a set seed at line 3 of the second cell of code so I could get the same game every time for narratation purposes, which it can be switched out with line 2 if you want to play through a different hand by yourself. If you do choose to play a different hand, I will warn that the code does not enforce that you follow suit in this version so be wary of that as you play.\n",

They can play their 10 of Hearts and walk it home safely or play a Spade and try and catch a card that counts towards game with the 10 of Hearts later. The latter option is quite risky because if Player 2 can't pass lead back to Player 1 before the end of the game, they will be forced to lead the 10 of Hearts in the last turn and be a sitting duck to be stolen by a higher trump. \n",

A 2-bid in trump would be quite risky, since Player 1 has no guarenteed points like a 2 of Clubs or an Ace of Clubs. Other things to consider while bidding first include intentionally bidding higher/riskier than what you think you can take in hopes that the other player will try to outbid you or to stop them from stealing your bid.
